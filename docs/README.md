## Features

### :information_source: Notes about the command format:

- **Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters** to be supplied by you.  
  e.g., in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo Read a book`.

- **Items in square brackets are optional**.  
  e.g., `snooze NUMBER [DATE]` can be used as `snooze 1` or `snooze 1 2025-12-25`.

- **Dates must be in YYYY-MM-DD format**.  
  e.g., `2025-12-25` for December 25, 2025.

- **Task numbers are 1-indexed**.  
  The first task in your list is task number 1, the second is task number 2, etc.

- **Commands are case-sensitive**.  
  Use lowercase commands like `list`, `todo`, `deadline`, etc.

## Data Storage

### Automatic saving
Audrey automatically saves your tasks to a file called `audrey_db.txt` in the same folder as the application. There's no need to save manually - your data is preserved every time you make changes.

### Data file location
Your task data is stored in `audrey_db.txt` in the application's home folder. The file uses a human-readable format:

```
[T][ ] Read a book
[D][X] Submit assignment (by:2025-12-25)
[E][ ] Conference (from:2025-12-20 to:2025-12-22)
```

### Manual editing
:exclamation: **Caution:** While you can manually edit the `audrey_db.txt` file, incorrect formatting may cause Audrey to lose your data. It's recommended to:
1. **Always backup** the file before manual editing
2. **Follow the exact format** shown above
3. **Use the application commands** instead of manual editing when possible

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my tasks to another computer?**  
A: Copy the `audrey_db.txt` file from your current Audrey folder to the new computer's Audrey folder.

**Q: What happens to snoozed tasks with past dates?**  
A: Tasks snoozed until a past date automatically become active again and will appear in your task list.

**Q: Can I use Audrey without the GUI?**  
A: Yes! Audrey is designed with CLI-first interaction. The GUI simply provides a visual interface for the same commands.

A: Only YYYY-MM-DD format is supported (e.g., 2025-12-25 for December 25, 2025).
