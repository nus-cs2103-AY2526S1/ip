## Features

### Adding Tasks

StackOverflown supports three types of tasks to cover all your productivity needs:

#### Adding a Todo Task
Create simple tasks without specific deadlines.

**Format:** `todo DESCRIPTION`

**Example:**
```
todo read Java programming book
```

**Expected output:**
```
Boom! A ToDo task just joined the party:
[T][] read Java programming book

Your task arsenal now stands at 1 strong!.
```

#### Adding a Deadline Task
Create tasks with specific due dates for time-sensitive work.

**Format:** `deadline DESCRIPTION /by YYYY-MM-DD HHMM`

**Examples:**
```
deadline submit assignment /by 2025-12-01
deadline project report /by 2025-11-30 2200
```

**Expected output:**
```
All set! A Deadline task just joined the party:
[D][]submit assignment (by: Dec 01 2025 11:59pm)
Your task arsenal now stands at 2 strong!

All set! A Deadline task just joined the party:
[D][]project report (by: Nov 30 2025 10:00pm)
Your task arsenal now stands at 3 strong!
```

> [NOTE]
> Time is optional for deadline tasks. If not specified, it defaults to end of day (11:59pm).

#### Adding an Event Task
Create tasks with start and end times for meetings and appointments.

**Format:** `event DESCRIPTION /from YYYY-MM-DD HHMM /to YYYY-MM-DD HHMM`

**Example:**
```
event team meeting /from 2025-12-10 1400 /to 2025-12-10 1600
```

**Expected output:**
```
Tada! An Event task just joined the party:
[E][]team meeting (from: Dec 10 2025 2:00pm to: Dec 10 2025 4:00pm)
Your task arsenal now stands at 4 strong!
```

### Managing Tasks

#### Marking Tasks as Done
Mark completed tasks with a checkmark for visual progress tracking.

**Format:** `mark INDEX`

**Example:**
```
mark 2
```

**Expected output:**
```
Boom! That task is history - marked as done and dusted:
[D][X]submit assignment (by: Dec 01 2025 11:59pm)
```

#### Unmarking Tasks
Remove the done status from tasks if you need to work on them again.

**Format:** `unmark INDEX`

**Example:**
```
unmark 2
```

**Expected output:**
```
Aha! This task is no longer done - it's waiting for your magic touch again:
[D][]submit assignment (by: Dec 01 2025 11:59pm)
```

#### Deleting Tasks
Permanently remove tasks you no longer need.

**Format:** `delete INDEX`

**Example:**
```
delete 3
```

**Expected output:**
```
Poof! Task vanished from existence:
[E][]team meeting (from: Dec 10 2025 2:00pm to: Dec 10 2025 4:00pm)

Your task arsenal now stands at 3 strong!
```

> [WARNING]
> Deleted tasks cannot be recovered. Make sure you really want to remove the task before confirming.

3. [E][]team meeting (from: Dec 10 2023 2:00PM to: Dec 10 2023 4:00PM)
```

**Task Status Indicators:**
- `[T]` = ToDo task

**Available Sort Options:**

| **Task Type** | `sort type` | Groups Todo → Deadline → Event |
| **Completion Status** | `sort status` | Pending tasks first, completed last |
