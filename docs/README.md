# Kiwi User Guide 🥝

![Kiwi Screenshot](Ui.png)

Kiwi is a **desktop app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Kiwi can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `Kiwi.jar` from [here](https://github.com/ZayK1/ip/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Kiwi.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar Kiwi.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features:

> **Notes about the command format:**<br>
> 
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
>   e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.
> 
> * Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
>   e.g `find KEYWORD` can be used as `find book` or just `find` (searches all tasks).

### Saving the data

Kiwi data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Kiwi data are saved automatically as a text file `[JAR file location]/data/kiwi.txt`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> ⚠️ **Caution:**
> If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Kiwi will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
