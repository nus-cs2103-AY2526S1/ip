## 💾 Saving the data

- Task data is written to disk when you use `bye`.
- The save file is created in your app’s data folder (e.g., inside the project or jar directory).  
  Keep the file if you want your tasks to persist next time.

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

- **Nothing happens when I press Enter**: Make sure the text field has focus (click it) and try again.
- **Date parsing failed**: Use the `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` format, e.g., `2025-01-02 18:30`.
- **App won’t start**: Verify `java --version` shows **17**.
