Get ready to Lock In with Locky, your friendly productivity tracker to keep track of your tasks!

## Add Todo tasks
Todo tasks are tasks to check off your todo lists without dates due associated with them.
To make a todo task, simply type

```
todo <description of task>
```

## Adding Deadline tasks
Have an assignment coming up, due 23:59? Locky keeps track of deadlines too, 
where you can input the **description** along with the **deadline** of the task
in **_yyyy-MM-dd HHmm_** format.

```
deadline <description> /by <deadline>
```

## Adding Event tasks
Put events like Jane's Birthday Party to block out entire blocks of time!
Simply input the **description**, along with the **start** and **end** dates in **_yyyy-MM-dd HHmm_** format.

```
event <description> /from <start> /to <end>
```

## List tasks
Locky keeps memory of your existing tasks! See the tasks you created both during and before a 
session.
