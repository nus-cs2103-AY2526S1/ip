## Getting Started

Lax commands generally follow a simple structure: `<prefix> <command> <details>`.

- `<prefix>` indicates whether you're managing tasks (`task`) or notes (`note`), seeking for help (`help`) or exiting
  the application (`bye`).
- `<command>` specifies the action you want to perform (e.g., `add`, `list`, `delete`).
- `<details>` provides additional information needed for the command (e.g., task description, note content).

Lax commands are case-insensitive, with trailing and leading spaces ignored.\
After every command, the list would be saved automatically into a `txt` file in the local directory.

## Features

**Notes about the command formatting:**

- words in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders for user input.
- words in `lowercase` are fixed keywords that must be typed exactly.
- dateTime format to be keyed in: `dd-MM-yyyy HHmm` (24-hour format)
- date format to be keyed in: `dd-MM-yyyy`
