## Data Storage

Snow automatically saves your tasks to a file called `data/snow.txt`. Your tasks will be preserved between sessions, so you don't have to worry about losing your data!

## Tips

1. **Use descriptive task names** - This makes it easier to find tasks later
2. **Set realistic deadlines** - Snow will help you stay organized 
3. **Use the find feature** - Quickly locate specific tasks
4. **Add locations** - Keep track of where you need to be
5. **Regular cleanup** - Delete completed tasks that you no longer need to track

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Snow won't start when I double-click the JAR file**  
A: Use the command line instead: `java -jar snow.jar`. JavaFX applications require specific launch parameters that aren't available when double-clicking.

**Q: Snow won't start from command line**  
A: Make sure you have Java 11 or later installed on your system. You can check with `java -version`.

**Q: My tasks disappeared**  
A: Check if the `data/snow.txt` file exists in the same folder as the Snow application.

**Q: Date format not recognized**  
A: Use the supported formats: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` or `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM`

**Q: Can't find a task**  
A: Use the `find` command with keywords from the task description.
