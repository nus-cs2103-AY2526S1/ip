Lux is a CLI-based chatbot that helps you stay productive by managing your To-Do list.
You can create, track, and organize tasks with simple commands.

## Features
Note:
- Commands are case-insensitive (i.e. Bye, bye, BYE) will all cause the program to exit.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as list and bye) will not be ignored. Please
leave out these extra parameters.
- Mass operations are only supported by Mark, Unmark, and Delete feature and DO NOT work with the find feature.
