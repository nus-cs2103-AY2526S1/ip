Rakan is a desktop app for managing tasks using an intuitive CLI, and gorgeous GUI.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have at least Java 17 on your computer.
2. Download the latest .jar release [here](https://github.com/harun-abdullah/ip/releases/tag/v0.2)
3. Open the program and get started!

## Features

There are 3 types of tasks the user can deal with in Rakan:
* Todos
* Deadlines
* Events


The user inputs commands to Rakan fully through the CLI.
The commands can be either typed in full form or short form, for convenience.

When typing in date times, the following format (dd/mm/yyyy hhmm) must be used.
E.g: "31/12/2020 1900"

Here are the list of commands to help you:

---

### Listing tasks - "list" / "l"

Lets the user view all their existing tasks in a list.
Takes no arguments.

Example: `list`

---

### Creating Todo tasks - "todo" / "t" + (description)

Lets the user create a todo task with only a description.

Example: `t read book`

---

### Creating Deadline tasks - "deadline" / "d" + (description) + "/by" + (date/time)
