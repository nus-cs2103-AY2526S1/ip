## Tips

- Dates can be entered with or without time (i.e `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` or `yyyy-MM-dd`)
- Dates can be entered in formats like `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` or `d/M/yyyy HH:mm`.
- You can tag tasks with multiple tags separated by commas.
- All data is saved automatically; no need to save manually.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see errors, check your command format and ensure all required arguments are present.
- For date/time errors, use valid formats and real dates (e.g., no Feb 30).
