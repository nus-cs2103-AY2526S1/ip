## Introduction

Yappy is a **todo list chatbot** that helps you organize and manage tasks through simple text commands.
You can quickly add tasks, set deadlines, track events or search for items.

Yappy supports these task types:

* **Todo** – a simple task to complete
* **Deadline** – a task with a due date
* **Event** – a task scheduled at a specific time
* **Fixed Duration Task** – a task with a set start and end time

### Quick overview of supported commands and their usage

> [!NOTE]
>* Regarding the command format:
>   * Unbracketed words within `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.  
>      e.g. in `todo <description>`, `description` is a parameter which can be used as `todo buy groceries`.  
>   * Words within `()` within a `<>` indicates that it is the type of the parameter enclosed within `<>`.  
>      e.g. in `mark <task index (int)>`, `int` is the type of the parameter `task index`.  
>      For parameters with unspecified type, it can be assumed to be a `string`.    
>   * Parameters are **non-optional** and **non-empty**, and need to be strictly in the order prescribed within the format.     
>   * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `bye` and `list`) will not be executed successfully. 
>* For arguments of `datetime` type, there are currently two supported formats:
>   * dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm (eg. `07-08-2025 07:00`)
>   * d MMM yyyy, HH:mm (eg. `7 Aug 2025, 07:00`)
>* For arguments of `duration` type, the supported format is XhYmZs (eg. `2h15m30s`) or any subset of hours, mins and sec (ie. `2h` or `15m30s` or `2h30s`) are also supported.

* `list`
* `todo <description>`
* `deadline <description> /by <deadline (datetime)>`
* `event <description> /from <start time (datetime)> /to <end time (datetime)>`
* `fixed_duration <description> /time <duration (duration)>`
* `mark <task index (int)>`
* `unmark <task index (int)>`
* `delete <task index (int)>`
* `find <keyword>`
* `bye`

## Features
> [!NOTE]
> Upon starting the program, it will look for a file named `data.dat` relative to the 
> present working directory which contains backup data from previous sessions.
> If it exists, the program will load the backup data, else it will just
> silently fail. To verify if the backing up from previous session worked, if the
> latest previous session ended with a non-empty list of tasks, executing `list`
> in the present session, should display a non-empty list of the tasks from the
> previous session.
>
> After each command, the program will backup the latest task list via a file
> named `data.dat` relative to the present working directory. If the file does not
> exist, the program will create the file.
>
> Deleting the `data.dat` file, will result in loss of backup data.
