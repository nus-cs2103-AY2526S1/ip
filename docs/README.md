Denz is a simple chatbot that helps you manage your tasks efficiently.  
It comes with both:
- A **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, for quick command-based usage.
- A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with JavaFX, for a more user-friendly experience.

It supports todos, deadlines, events, reminders, and more.  
Your tasks are automatically saved between sessions, so you never lose them.
