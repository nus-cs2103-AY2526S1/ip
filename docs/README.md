## Introduction
Performative is a desktop app for managing tasks in different formats, such as to-dos, deadlines and events. 
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), 
while having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer. 
Mac users: Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed here.
2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/blurfrost/ip/releases/tag/v0.2).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Performative application.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the `.jar` file in, and run the command:
   `java -jar performative.jar`
A GUI similar to the above screenshot should appear in a few seconds. 

## Features

> **Note: About date time formats**
> 
>
> [date] can be represented in the formats 'YYYY-MM-DD' or by the day of the week (e.g. Mon, Monday), in which the next 
> occurence of the specified day will be used.
> 
> [time] is in the 24-hour format 'HHMM'. If day of the week is used for [date], 
> it is optional to include the this field, in which a default timing (according to the feature) will be set.


### Adding to-dos: `todo`

To-dos consist of a task description.

Format: `todo [description]`

For example, `todo read book` has the task saved and displayed as:

```
[T][] read book
```

### Adding deadlines: `deadline`

Deadlines consist of a task description and a due date and time.

Format: `deadline [description] /by [date] [time]` 

This command adds a deadline with a description and a due date and time.

For example, `deadline submit report /by 2025-12-25 1900` has the task saved and displayed as:

```
[D][] submit report (by: 25 Dec 2025 1900)
```

If a day of week is set in the [date], the time is set to 2359 by default if not specified. 

For example, `deadline prepare for presentation /by Mon` has the task saved and displayed as:

```
[D][] prepare for presentation (by: 22 Sep 2025 2359)
```

For example: `deadline wash dishes /by Mon 1900` has the task saved and displayed as:

```
[D][] wash dishes (by: 22 Sep 2025 1900)
```

(in the above examples, if today is 19 Sep 2025, a Friday, the 'Mon' will be set as the next Monday, 22 Sep 2025)

### Adding events: `event`

Events consist of a task description, a start date and time, and an end date and time.

Format: `event [description] /at [start date] [start time] to [end date] [end time]`

This command adds an event with a description, a start date and time, and an end date and time.

For example, `event outing /from 2025-12-25 1200 /to 2025-12-26 1200` has the task saved and displayed as:

```
[E][] outing (from: 25 Dec 2025 1200, to: 26 Dec 2025 1200)
```

If a day of week is set in the [date], the time is set to 0900 by default if not specified.

For example, `event conference /from Mon 1200 /to Tue 2200` has the task saved and displayed as:

```
[E][] conference (from: 22 Sep 2025 1200, to: 23 Sep 2025 2200)
```

For example: `event short trip /from Mon /to Tue` has the task saved and displayed as:

```
[D][] short trip (from: 22 Sep 2025 0900, to: 23 Sep 2025 0900)
```

### Listing all tasks: `list`

This command lists all tasks in the task list.

Format: `list`

### Finding tasks by substring: `find`

This command finds tasks whose descriptions contain the given substring.

Format: `find [substring]`

- The search is case-insensitive.
- As long as the substring appears in the description, it is considered a match. 
- E.g. 'find book' will match a task with description 'read book' and 'read books'.

### Marking / unmarking a task as done/undone: `mark`/`unmark`

This command marks/unmarks a task as done/undone based on the command given.

Format: `mark [task number]` / `unmark [task number]`

- `mark` marks the task corresponding to the task number as done.
- `unmark` marks the task corresponding to the task number as undone.

For example, in this task list:
```
1.[T][] read book
2.[D][X] submit report (by: 25 Dec 2025 2359)
```

- `mark 1` will mark the first task as done, changing the task list to:
```
1.[T][X] read book
2.[D][X] submit report (by: 25 Dec 2025 2359)
```

- `unmark 2` will mark the second task as undone, changing the task list to:
```
1.[T][] read book
2.[D][] submit report (by: 25 Dec 2025 2359)
```

### Deleting a task: `delete`

This command deletes a task based on the task number given.

Format: `delete [task number]`

For example, in this task list:
```
1.[T][] read book
2.[D][X] submit report (by: 25 Dec 2025 2359)
```

`delete 1` will delete the first task, changing the task list to:
```
1.[D][X] submit report (by: 25 Dec 2025 2359
```

### Saving data

Tasks are saved in the hard disk automatically after every command that modifies the task list. 
There is no need to perform a manual save.

### Editing the data file

Task data is saved automatically in a .txt file `[JAR file location]/data/savefile.txt`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.
