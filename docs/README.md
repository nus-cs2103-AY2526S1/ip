  * `todo`: A basic task with just a description.
  * `deadline`: A task with a description and a due date.
  * `event`: A task that includes a description along with a start and end time.
* **Task Operations**: You can perform the following commands:
  * `list`: Displays all your outstanding tasks.
  * `mark <index>`: Marks a specified task as complete.
  * `unmark <index>`: Marks a specified task as incomplete.
  * `delete <index>`: Removes a task from your list permanently.
  * `find <keyword>`: Searches for and lists all tasks containing a specific word or phrase.
* **Data Persistence**: The task list is automatically saved to a serialized file named `JohnChatbotSave.ser` and is loaded when the application starts, so you never lose your data.
