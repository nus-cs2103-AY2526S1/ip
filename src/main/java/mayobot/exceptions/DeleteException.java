/**
 * Exception thrown when the delete command input format is incorrect.
 * <p>
 * This exception is raised when users provide invalid input for the delete command,
 * which removes tasks from the task list. The delete command expects a valid
 * task number as its argument: {@code delete <task_number>}
 * <p>
 * Common scenarios that trigger this exception:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>No task number provided (empty arguments)</li>
 *   <li>Task index is out of bounds (referring to a non-existent task)</li>
 *   <li>Whitespace-only input</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This exception covers both format validation (missing arguments) and
 * range validation (invalid task indices) for the delete operation.
