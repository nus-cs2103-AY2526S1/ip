## Features  

:information_source: **Notes about the command format:**  
- Words in **UPPER_CASE** are parameters to be supplied by you.  
  Example: in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.
- Items in **square brackets** are optional.  
  Example: `list [/alphabetical]` can be just `list` or `list /alphabetical`.
- Parameters must be entered in the specified order.  
- Task indexes refer to the number shown in the task list.

### Listing tasks : `list`  
Displays your current tasks. 
You can sort them in different ways (alphabetical order, date order or type order).  

**Format:**  
```
list [/alphabetical | /date | /type] 
```

**Examples:**  
- `list` — shows tasks in the order added.  
- `list /alphabetical` — sorts by description.  
- `list /date` — sorts by date.  
- `list /type` — groups todos, deadlines, and events.

- `mark 2` — marks the 2nd task in the list as done.

---

### Finding tasks : `find`  
Searches for tasks containing a keyword in their description.  
Search is case-insensitive.

**Format:**

find KEYWORD
```  

**Examples:**  
- `find book` — finds all tasks with “book” in the description.  
- `find report` — finds all tasks mentioning “report”.

### Exiting the program : `bye`  
Closes the application.  

**Format:**  
```
bye
```

## Saving the data  
- Jett automatically saves your tasks after every command that modifies data.  
- Your data is stored in the hard disk at:  
  ```
  [JAR file location]/data/Jett.txt
  ```  
- There is no need to save manually.  

---

## Editing the data file  
Advanced users may edit `Jett.txt` directly to change saved tasks. 

:exclamation: **Caution:** If you make formatting errors, Jett may fail to load the file and will start with an empty task list. Always back up before editing manually.

---

## FAQ  

**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?  
**A:** Install Jett on the other computer, then overwrite its empty `data/Jett.txt` file with your existing file.
