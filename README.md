## Quick Start

### Installation (Windows)
Click this link and download
### First run
Run the application directly 
### Basic workflow 
Refer to the text box. Put in the command and press send everytime
You can try to start adding a simple `todo` command and use `list` to show it.
Make sure that your command is supported or appears on this user guide!

## Concepts

1. **Task types**: For each task we track in the chatbot, it comes with different types , which includes "todo", "event", "deadline", "recurring". 
Every task can be marked done with the mark command and unmarked using the unmark command. When a task is done and marked, the box in front of the task description will look like `[X]`


2. **Todo** : A simple task that only has a description.

3. **Deadline** : A  task that has a description and a deadline. The program will show (Overdue!) on the task description when the due is past.

4. **Event** : A task that has a description and a starting/ending time. The program will show (Happening!) on the task description when today is within the event period.

5. **Recurring** : A task that has a description and a starting time and an interval(in number of days). Each happening of the event is calculated by the formula `starting date + interval(in days) * n`. The program will show the most recent happening of the event **past and including** today

## Error handling

### Common errors and meanings
An error is returned when the dialog box of the chat bot turns red 
The error message is usually indicative of where the problem is with your command
The following are a few examples 

### Invalid date/time
It usually returns the following error message  
>"Your date seems weird..."

Remember to check the default date format before inputing the command

### Unknown command / option
It usually returns the following error message  
>"I don't understand what you are saying"

Remember to check all available commands



## FAQ

### How are IDs assigned?
The IDs are assigned in the ascending numerical order.
Whenever a task is deleted. The order will be readjusted such that the **index will always increase only by 1 between adjacent tasks in the list**
### What date formats are supported?
See [defualt date format](#default-datetime-format-preferences).
Sadly, other date formats are currently unsupported
