### Tips
* Task numbers start from 1 and are shown when you use the list command
* Bug automatically saves your tasks, so you won't lose them when you close the application
* If you make a mistake in a command, Bug will show you a helpful error message
* Commands are case-insensitive, so LIST, list, and List all work the same way
