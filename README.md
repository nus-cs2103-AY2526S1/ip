Kuro is a **personal task management** chatbot with GUI that helps you stay organized and productive.
Using simple text commands, you can:
- List all your task
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks you no longer need
- Mark tasks as done
- Unmark tasks if needed
- Filter out a specific task with fuzzy search

Kuro currently supports multiple task types:
1. Todos: simple tasks without specific timeline
2. Deadlines: tasks with a due date
3. Events: Tasks with start and end times

Whether you are managing school, work or personal goals, Kuro can help you easily keep track of everything in one place

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 17, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 17** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Kuro.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Kuro.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
   ```
   ____________________________________________________________
    Konnichiwa! I'm Kuro
    What can I do for you?
   ____________________________________________________________
   ```
1. Alternatively, open up the terminal and run the command `./gradlew run` and you will see the GUI pop up and Kuro will send the welcome message like below:
   ```
   ____________________________________________________________
    Konnichiwa! I'm Kuro
    What can I do for you?
   ____________________________________________________________
   ```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.
